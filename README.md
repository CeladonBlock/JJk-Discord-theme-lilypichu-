Hello, you can call me celadon I guess, I'm a big fan of the theme lilypichu, but it was too much pink for my taste,
so I had the idea to modify it and make the theme into a Jujutsu Kaisen theme, sadly I got some problems while trying do make it.

For example, one of the parts which I need to modift and edit is "https://nyri4.github.io/", and the problem with it is that I don't know how
to modify this part, probably because I don't know anything about CSS and stuff ðŸ˜µðŸ¥´

I hope I'm can overcome these challenges and finish this theme that is probably only 20% mine [Since the creator isn't me]
